#***PLOC***Building a Container Ecosystem***PLOC***

***PLOC***To understand why building a container ecosystem is so important, let's first talk about Docker.***PLOC***

##***PLOC***Docker’s Appeal***PLOC***

***PLOC***The concept of containers (namespace isolation and resource governance) has been around for a long time, going back to BSD Jails, Solaris Zones and the basic UNIX chroot (change root) mechanism.***PLOC***
***PLOC***What Docker has done is provide a common toolset, packaging model, and deployment mechanism.***PLOC***
***PLOC***By doing so, Docker greatly simplified the containerization and distribution of applications.***PLOC***
***PLOC***Those applications can then run anywhere on any Linux host, a capability we're providing on Windows as well.***PLOC***

***PLOC***This ubiquitous technology not only simplifies management by offering the same management commands against any host, it also creates a unique opportunity for seamless DevOps.***PLOC***

***PLOC***From a developer’s desktop to a testing machine to a set of production machines, a Docker image can be created that will deploy identically across any environment in seconds.***PLOC***
***PLOC***This story has created a massive and growing ecosystem of applications packaged in Docker containers, with DockerHub, the public containerized-application registry that Docker maintains.***PLOC***

***PLOC***Docker provides a great foundation for development.***PLOC***

***PLOC***Now let's talk about that ecosystem of applications and how you can build on Docker concepts to create a development and deployment workflow suited to your needs.***PLOC***

##***PLOC***Components in a container ecosystem***PLOC***

***PLOC***Windows Server Containers are a key component of a large container ecosystem.***PLOC***
***PLOC***We’re working across the industry to deliver developer choice at each layer of the solution stack.***PLOC***

***PLOC***The container ecosystem provides ways to manage containers, share containers and develop apps that run in containers.***PLOC***

***PLOC***Microsoft wants to empower developer choice and productivity as they build these next-gen apps.***PLOC***
***PLOC***Our goal is to fuel developer productivity which means enabling applications to target any Microsoft cloud without having to modify, rewrite, or reconfigure code.***PLOC***

***PLOC***Microsoft is committed to being open and ecosystem friendly.***PLOC***
***PLOC***We actively support the coming together of multiple developer ecosystems of interest – such as Windows and Linux – to drive innovation.***PLOC***

***PLOC***Over the coming months, we will be providing more information about additional partners in this developing ecosystem.***PLOC***
